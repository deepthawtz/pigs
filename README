What is This?

An educational journey for me in Perl. 

Makes use of some of Perl's best offerings:

Getopt::Long + pod2usage = The Dynamic Duo (http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=155288)

Perl6::Form - Think whatever you think about Perl. Damian Conway (http://search.cpan.org/~dconway/), (http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~damian/) is freakin' amazing. If you have not personally seen Acme::Bleach you are missing out big time, and Acme::Morse too. Quantum::Superpositions is a trip too. Just check out this guys code. And this guy knows how to write a README like nobody's business.

Proc::ProcessTable for reading /proc tables - though I don't think this is portable (?).

RRD::Simple is the Perl interface to rrdtool (also required for this program).

See the perldoc at the end of the source code (if you really care) for the available options.
